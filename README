# ABOUT THE ELECTIS VOTING APP 

Electeez (electis.app) is an open source semi-decentralized voting platform. 

It is using [election guard] (https://www.electionguard.vote/) for its voting engine and the [Tezos blockchain] (tezos.com) to store the results in the form of a smart contract pointing to an IPFS link with all the details to re-run an encrypted tally. Electeez can be used for low-stakes elections when the organizer hosting the server can be trusted. 

Electis.app is built to be as easy to use as possible for anyone to participate or organize elections. It also allows technical auditors to verify as many pieces of information as possible  (e.g re-running the tally etc...) 

The elections are organized by a Guardian (Multi guardians on our roadmap) A guardian is in charge of the secrecy of the elections by holding an encryption key used to encrypt ballots. 

The votes are encrypted and trackable voters can  verify at the end of the election that their ballots are counted. 

 Individual Ballots are always encrypted and their tallying is done via an homomorphic encryption (only the sum of the ballots is decrypted) 

This project is developed by electis in partnership with Tezos via its foundation #MORE INFO you can find more information about electis and electeez on https://www.electis.io/about you can test an online version of electeez on https://www.electis.app
