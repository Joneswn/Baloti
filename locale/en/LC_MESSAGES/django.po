"As a way to bring trust, this election results and parameters will be shared "
"and stored via a Tezos smart contract and an IPFS Link. To keep it simple "
"you have two choices, one is to chose the free / testnet contract (fine for "
"non official elections) or the main net one (you ll need to pay a small "
"fee / just send the needed Tez fees to the Wallet address) version that can "
"be used for official election as the equivalent of a legal proof of the "
"election parameters and its results."
